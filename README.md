# hopper

Command-line programs to disassemble Motorola 68000 executables built for Atari TOS,
and Motorola 56000 files for the Atari Falcon DSP chip.

The code is written so that the decoder libraries (which parse data and generate
a symbolic representation of the instructions) are separate and can be built as
libraries to include in other projects.
